# Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)

 Here we describe locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsu- pervised learning algorithm that computes low dimensional, neighborhood preserving embeddings of high dimensional data. LLE attempts to discover nonlinear structure in high dimensional data by exploiting the local symme- tries of linear reconstructions.
